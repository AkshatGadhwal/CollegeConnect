College Connect is an Android application aimed to be a one stop shop for all the college needs irrespective of college and course.

It aims to create a helpful platform for all college students.

The app uses Material UI for an attractive interface (subject to improvement) which attracts user to stay on the app for more time.

This idea was developed for Ideathon held in BVCOE, New Delhi where it was presented to be a college app for BVCOE.

Later it was converted to be a app for every college and course in India.

The app is in currently in development phase.

It's is being build by @saksham0804 and @sjain30
